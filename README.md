## Vietnam Road to National: Southern Qualification Season 25-26 - 2025/11/22-23

Time for southern teams to qualify for the National Championship in February 2026. While looking forward to this first Signature event, it is a tough competition between the 37 teams on the [Vietnam Road to National: Southern Qualification Season 25-26](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-V5RC-25-1400.html#agenda).

Qualified for the National Chamionship are:

- 23457S	BRICK Lab SUPER	5-0-0	11 / 50 / 128
- 62024N	Panda Robotics	4-1-0	11 / 40 / 143
- 50922T	LSTS MAKO MANIACS	4-2-0	11 / 40 / 102
- 28176N	Overwatch	5-1-0	10 / 35 / 186
- 1599N	SSIS Big Pink Pegasus

It was an [eventful](https://www.youtube.com/live/fuf7YvmOIrU) weekend. The teamwork is on full display, the robots are getting more sophisticated and the notebooks improve their quality, too. Team [20226H](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/V5RC/20226H) (NGS Hogrider) from the [Hanoi–Amsterdam High School for the Gifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi%E2%80%93Amsterdam_High_School) really improved their gameplay and design in just a few weeks. Their robot design has 6 motors for 4 omniwheels and 2 traction wheels 3.25" diameter to be more agile. Per calculation of the gears this should result in 360 rpm on the wheels. It resulted in the **INNOVATE Award** for this team!

Almost unbeatable again: [50922T LSTS MAKO MANIACS](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/V5RC/50922T) with the **Excellence Award**, **Tournament Champion** and **Skills Champion**. Congratulations! Their robot is also driven by six 11W motors, but has only 4 omniwheels 3.25 inch. Their secret? **460 rpm** on the wheels, they are really fast! Being pushed from the side is not a question, they are out of their way too fast. Another omniwheel in the center is used for odometry.

As I learned there are more ways to qualify for VEX Worlds. For example there are the [Online Challenges](https://challenges.robotevents.com/). It was highlighted at VEX Nationals last season, and team 36070M won a spot at VEX World 2025 as [Team 11](https://challenges.robotevents.com/user/144229) in 2025 Challenges > [STEM Advocacy Challenge - High School](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/287/stem-advocacy-challenge/entry) > [Empowering Cao Bang through Robotics](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/287/stem-advocacy-challenge/entry/14761) with a [PDF file](https://challenges.robotevents.com/uploads/0025238_original.pdf) (39 pages) or a [website](https://sites.google.com/view/team-11-36070m/home). And then there are other challenges like [IECF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_and_Engineering_Fair) challenge that teams from Vietnam can participate in.
